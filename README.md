## Overview

### The Challenge

The goal of this project was to build a responsive landing page for Huddle with curved sections. The design was provided by Frontend Mentor, and the challenge was to replicate the design as closely as possible while ensuring the page is fully responsive across all devices.

**Requirements:**
- Replicate the design provided by Frontend Mentor.
- Ensure the page is fully responsive (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- Add hover states for interactive elements.
- Use semantic HTML and maintain clean, reusable CSS.

## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for better accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, and custom properties for styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **BEM Methodology**: For clean and maintainable CSS.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and deployment.

### What I Learned

- **Curved Sections**: I learned how to create curved sections using CSS properties like `border-radius` and `clip-path`.
- **Responsive Design**: I improved my skills in creating responsive layouts using media queries and flexible units like `rem`, `em`, and `%`.
- **BEM Methodology**: I practiced using the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention to write clean and maintainable CSS.
- **Accessibility**: I ensured the page is accessible by using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where necessary.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to:
- Explore more advanced CSS techniques like animations and transitions.
- Dive deeper into JavaScript to add more interactivity.
- Learn about performance optimization for faster page loads.
